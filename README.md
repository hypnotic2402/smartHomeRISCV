# Custom RISCV-based Power System for Smart Home with Burglar Alarm

## Aim

In this project aims to create a system will intelligently manage power usage within a smart home environment, ensuring that power is conserved when no occupants are detected and providing robust security through a burglar alarm system. Instead of using traditional microcontrollers such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi, We use a custom RISCV based microcontroller that is designed to perform this specific operation.
